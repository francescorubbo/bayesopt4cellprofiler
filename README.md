In order to use the developed plugins

After installation, save the three plugins (python scrips) into a folder.
Go to the program's File > Preferences menu. Choose the folder as plugins source
and restart the program.

After the restart, the plugins should be available in the module list under the
"Advanced" category.

You can now drag and drop a pipeline file into the program as well as the
